Left4Dead2 Trainer is a simple trainer using read and write memory. I was able to get static adresses from console in game commands. In that
way we don't need to get "sv_cheats 1" to get this tool worked. Be aware, this tool is for purpose only and research don't and never ever use it on
vac3 secured servers or you will get banned. This code is pretty simple, need to be improved like: PatternScan, loop check though every chapters/maps...
